# Topic-Modeling the National Conversation

## Background
Final project for course *Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning* (DTSA-5510) at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Description
The project analyzes HuffPost articles labeled as “Queer Voices” to identify dominant topics before and after the 2016 U.S. elections. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, it uncovers shifts in discourse within the LGBTQ+ community.

### Objective:

To provide insights into how the national conversation on LGBTQ+ issues, as reflected in media, evolved during a significant political event.

### Key Features:
* **Data Collection**: Compilation of articles from HuffPost’s “Queer Voices” section, focusing on content published around the 2016 election.
* **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
* **Topic Modeling**: Application of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to extract prevalent topics and their evolution over time.
* **Visualization**: Graphical representation of topic distributions to facilitate interpretation of the findings.

### Results (summary)
The table below shows the topics in the Queer-Voices articles before and after the 2016 U.S. elections, lined up so that topics that appeared both before and after are on the same line and highlighted in green. (Note that whether two topics should be considered the same topic involves a judgement call.) Topics within a time period that seem very similar to each other are placed in the same cell, indicating that they should be merged. 

The two new topics in the "after" set that seems most interesting are highlighted in yellow.

# Topic-Modeling the National Conversation

## Background
Final project for course *Unsupervised Algorithms in Machine Learning* (DTSA-5510) at University of Colorado Boulder.

## Description
The project analyzes HuffPost articles labeled as “Queer Voices” to identify dominant topics before and after the 2016 U.S. election. Using unsupervised machine learning techniques, it uncovers shifts in discourse within the LGBTQ+ community.

### Key Features:
* **Data Collection**: Compilation of articles from HuffPost’s “Queer Voices” section, focusing on content published around the 2016 election.
* **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing textual data for analysis, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and lemmatization.
* **Topic Modeling**: Application of algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract prevalent topics and their evolution over time.
	•	Visualization: Graphical representation of topic distributions and trends to facilitate interpretation of the findings.

Objective:

To provide insights into how the national conversation on LGBTQ+ issues, as reflected in media, evolved during a significant political event, highlighting the impact of societal changes on community-focused journalism.
